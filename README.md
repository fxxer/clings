**clings** brings the power of [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) to your terminal. Manage tasks, projects, and workflows with natural language, bulk operations, and powerful search - all without leaving the command line.

## Features

### 1. View Commands

Access all your Things 3 lists directly:

```bash
clings today             # or: clings t (default command)
clings inbox             # or: clings i
clings upcoming          # or: clings u
clings anytime
clings someday           # or: clings s
clings logbook           # or: clings l

# Organization
clings projects          # List all projects
clings areas             # List all areas
clings tags list         # List all tags
clings show <ID>         # Show details of a specific todo
```

### 2. Natural Language Task Entry

Add tasks using natural language parsing:

```bash
clings add "buy milk tomorrow #errands"
clings add "call mom friday 3pm for Family !high"
clings add "finish report by dec 15 #work"
clings add "review PR // needs careful testing - check auth - verify tests"

# Supported patterns:
# - Dates: today, tomorrow, next monday, in 3 days, dec 15
# - Times: 3pm, 15:00, morning, evening
# - Tags: #tag1 #tag2
# - Projects: for ProjectName
# - Areas: in AreaName
# - Deadlines: by friday
# - Priority: !high, !!, !!!
# - Notes: // notes at the end
# - Checklist: - item1 - item2
```

You can also use explicit flags:

```bash
clings add "Task title" \
  --when tomorrow \
  --deadline "2024-12-31" \
  --tags work urgent \
  --project "Sprint 1" \
  --area "Work" \
  --notes "Additional context"

# Preview without creating
clings add "Test task tomorrow #work" --parse-only
```

### 3. Search and Filter

Search todos by text, or use the powerful filter command for advanced queries:

```bash
# Text search (case-insensitive, searches title and notes)
clings search "meeting"
clings find "project report"     # alias for search
clings f "status"                # short alias

# Advanced filtering (SQL-like query language)
clings filter "status = open"
clings filter "due < today AND status = open"
clings filter "tags CONTAINS 'urgent'"
clings filter "name LIKE '%report%'"
clings filter "project IS NOT NULL"
```

**Filter operators:** `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `LIKE`, `CONTAINS`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `IN`
**Logic:** `AND`, `OR`
**Fields:** `status`, `due` / `deadline`, `tags`, `project`, `area`, `name`, `notes`, `created`, `startdate`, `recurring`

### 4. Todo Management

Manage individual todos:

```bash
# Show details
clings show <ID>

# Update properties
clings update <ID> --name "New title"
clings update <ID> --notes "Updated notes"
clings update <ID> --due 2024-12-25
clings update <ID> --tags work urgent

# Schedule and organize (requires auth token, see Configuration)
clings update <ID> --when tomorrow
clings update <ID> --heading "Waiting on them"
clings update <ID> --when today --heading "In Progress"

# Complete, cancel, or delete
clings complete <ID>             # or: clings done <ID>
clings complete --title "milk"   # complete by title search
clings reopen <ID>               # reopen a completed/canceled todo
clings cancel <ID>
clings delete <ID>               # or: clings rm <ID>
clings delete <ID> --force       # skip confirmation
```

### 5. Bulk Operations

Perform operations on multiple tasks using powerful filters.

> **Data Safety:** Bulk operations include built-in safety measures. Operations affecting more than 5 items require confirmation. Always use `--dry-run` first to preview changes.

```bash
# ALWAYS preview changes first with --dry-run
clings bulk complete --where "tags CONTAINS 'done'" --dry-run

# Complete matching tasks
clings bulk complete --where "tags CONTAINS 'done'"

# Cancel old project tasks
clings bulk cancel --where "project = 'Old Project'"

# Tag work tasks as urgent
clings bulk tag --where "project = 'Work'" urgent priority

# Move tasks to a project
clings bulk move --where "tags CONTAINS 'work'" --to "Work Project"
```

**Safety options:**
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying them
- `--yes` - Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution)
- `--list` - Specify which list to operate on (default: today)

### 6. Statistics Dashboard

Track your productivity:

```bash
clings stats              # Show dashboard
clings stats trends       # Completion trends over time
clings stats heatmap      # Activity heatmap calendar
clings stats --days 7     # Limit to last 7 days
```

### 7. Weekly Review

Guide yourself through a GTD-style weekly review:

```bash
clings review             # Start a new review (default)
clings review start       # Same as above
clings review status      # Show last review session info
clings review clear       # Clear review session
```

### 8. Shell Completions

Generate shell completions:

```bash
clings completions bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/clings
clings completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_clings
clings completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/clings.fish
```

### 9. Configuration

Set up the Things 3 auth token for features that use the Things URL scheme (`--when`, `--heading`):

```bash
# Get your auth token from Things 3:
# Settings > General > Enable Things URLs > Copy auth token

# Save it to clings
clings config set-auth-token <your-token>
```

The auth token is stored at `~/.config/clings/auth-token` with restricted permissions (0600).

## Output Formats

### Pretty (default)

Human-readable colored output:

```
Today (3 items)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
[ ] Review PR #123        Development   Dec 15   #work
[ ] Buy groceries         -             -        #personal
[x] Call dentist          Health        Dec 10   -
```

### JSON

Machine-readable JSON for scripting:

```bash
clings today --json | jq '.items[] | select(.tags | contains(["work"]))'
```

## Data Safety

- **Read operations:** Use direct SQLite access to the Things 3 database (read-only)
- **Write operations:** Use Apple's JavaScript for Automation (JXA) through the official Things 3 API
- **Scheduling and headings:** Use the Things 3 URL scheme (requires auth token) since `activationDate` is read-only in JXA
- **No direct database writes:** clings never writes directly to the Things 3 database

### Best Practices

1. **Always use `--dry-run` first** when running bulk operations
2. **Start with small filters** to verify your filter expression matches what you expect
3. **Keep Things 3 backups** - Things 3 syncs to iCloud automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Automation permission error

```bash
open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Automation"
```

Then enable Things 3 under your terminal application.

### Things 3 not running

Things 3 must be running for clings to communicate with it via AppleScript/JXA.

## Development

```bash
swift build              # Build
swift run clings today   # Run in debug mode
swift test               # Run tests
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidelines.
